This is a placeholder file.

The application requires a plain text file named 'codenames.txt' in the project root.

This file should contain a list of unique words, one per line, which the application

will randomly select from to populate the game board.

Replace this content with your desired list of words (at least 25 unique words are needed

for one game board).
